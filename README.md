# AlphaVantageSimple
A simple android client library for students to use a single alphavantage endpoint.

### Warning
Do not use this for anything serious, it was made for students having issues with Async programming.
If you use this in the UI thread, it will cause frame drops as it circumvents Androids protections against running
network I/O in UI threads.
